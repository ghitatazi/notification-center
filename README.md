## Installation

- Clone the project and install the dependencies (npm install)

## Running the application

In a terminal, go to the root of your project and run:<br />
`yarn run dev`<br />
The server should be running correctly.<br />
The terminal console tells you which URL you should use in your browser to access the application.<br />

## Testing the application

I have installed Jest to do unit testing (yarn run test), but I didn't have time to write the tests<br />
I also wanted to use React Testing Library to test my components functionally
